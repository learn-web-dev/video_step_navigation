Feature: Using oven to heat room
  As an impoverished dweller in a northeastern city
  I can use the oven to heat a room during the winter months
  So that I know 1 room is warm if a utility is shut off.

Feature: Using oven to store pots/pans
    As a dweller in a small apt/condo/house
    I can use the oven to store pots/pans
    So that I can use the cabinet space for other kitchen materials.

Feature: Using oven to slow cook meals
      As a very active and time conscious person
      I can use the oven to slowly and safely cook meals
      So that I can do other activities with my time
