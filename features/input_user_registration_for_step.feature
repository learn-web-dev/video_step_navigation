Feature: inputting the user registration info at drupal.org
As an user
I input my information
So that I can access information.

Scenario: Asking for registration info such as email, user name, and password to verify I am a person.


Originally thinking it was a means to an ends, but made more general and thinking of the end goal.
I made the change because I input my information not just as a trade off to register, but because I believe
it's worth it.
