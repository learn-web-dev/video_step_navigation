As a visitor
I can click an instructional step
So that I can watch a related video clip.

/*
Discussion: (note that this part is 'commented out'; we won't always need discussion but it can be good to save it with the story when it helps clarify)
- the user story doesn't distinguish between videos; if there are 14 steps on a given page, the clips could be from 14 different videos or from 4 or from 1
