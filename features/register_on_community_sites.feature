  Jasen's comment:
    Originally thinking it was a means to an ends, but made more general and thinking of the end goal.
    I made the change because I input my information not just as a trade off to register, but because I believe
    it's worth it.

  Kay's response:
    There are improvements in your approach. Ensure you understand the actual challenge and that you incorporate all parts of it. I think the quality will improve further in your next round.
    Just as a drill, please follow the process below very exactly:
      1) pull the changes once I've pushed
      2) review comments in the code you just submitted
      3) review the comments and format in the "features/click_step_see_video_clip.feature" file that we're using as a pattern
      4) break out the exact details of the challenge
      you can do so in the 'discussion' section
      5) push the breakout of challenges
      6) start revising the user story
      7) note progress, questions and uncertainties in Hangouts as you go
