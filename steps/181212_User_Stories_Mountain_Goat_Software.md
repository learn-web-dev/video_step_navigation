User stories

What is a User Story
-User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system.
-User Stories strongly shift the focus from writing about features to discussing them.

What is an Epic:  Epic is a story that covers a large amount of functionality for example: As a User, I can backup my entire hard drive.
Because they hold so much, they're split into smaller user stories.  Such as:
As a power user, I can specify files or folders to backup based on file size, date created and date modified.
As a user, I can indicate folders not to backup so that my backup drive isn't filled up with things I don't need saved.

But they can be split into even more, depending on what the user is looking for.


Example of a User Story:
As a vice president of marketing,
I want to select a holiday season to be used when reviewing the performance of past advertising campaigns
so that I can identify profitable ones.

You can add more details to the User Story to the following conditions of satisfaction for example:
-Make sure it works with major retail holidays: Christmas, Easter, President’s Day, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, Labor Day, New Year’s Day.
-Support holidays that span two calendar years (none span three).
-Holiday seasons can be set from one holiday to the next (such as Thanksgiving to Christmas).
-Holiday seasons can be set to be a number of days prior to the holiday.

Anyone can write user stories, its far less important who writes it vs who is involved in the discussion of it.

User Stories are written throughout the entire process. It can begin at the start.
