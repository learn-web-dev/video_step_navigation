After reading a user story, the team knows why they are building what they're building and what value it creates.
They help provide a user-focused framework for daily work â€” which drives collaboration, creativity, and a better product overall.
Described as Persona+need+purpose

Step 1: Know User Personas (Whom are you writing it for?)
Step 2:  Describe the intent, not the features to use. What are you trying to achieve?
Step 3: Write why this is important? What's the purpose of why the user would do this? What's the result?
Step 4: Finish the story and come back to it 5-10 minutes later, ask yourself is it specific? Who is this for? Would you like to make it more clear?  If so, rewrite it as such.
